# bwr's fortunes

Almost all of these fortunes are borrowed from [anandjeyahar's
 rationality-fortunes](https://github.com/emofeedback/rationality-fortunes).

I've added a very small number of my own fortunes as well, but primarily
this represents a cleaned-up version of that collection: I removed
the points and submitters' handles from the LW Reddit Thread (I'm
grateful to the posters, of course, but don't think it's necessary
to credit them directly in the fortunes; check out the source
repository for that info). I also forced the fortunes into 70
characters for legibility using `fold`.

Finally, I added a Makefile with three targets: `all`, `clean`, and `install`.

I'm not sure if I'll ever add more fortunes here, but it will be convenient
to have this repository if I ever do want to.

I'm not very certain of the validity of releasing a quotes archive
under a copyleft license - presumably the authors or their corporate avatars
control the copyright to some of these quotes. I will, of course, respond
appropriately to copyright claims if necessary)
